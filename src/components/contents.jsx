        <p>In the United States, ice cream must contain 10 to 16 percent milk fat. 
            Higher milk fat ice creams generally
             have a smoother texture 
            because they contain a lower amount of water and, 
            therefore, fewer ice crystals. Ice creams that contain less than 10% milkfat are referred to as "ice milk" or more popularly, "low fat" ice cream.</p>
